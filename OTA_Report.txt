1>Answer:-

a>:- I have load data set into python through pandas, in pandas have multiple functions 
     to read the data. So We used the read_csv because the data set format is in the form
     of CSV.

b>:- I have performed summary statistics through the describe() methods, which give eight
     things like count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, and max. Issues is that many 
     features have a standard deviation that is too high.


c>:- I have performed exploratory analysis, but I am not got any collinearities because 
     I have already dropped those have columns that have more than 40% data is null. So
     the probability is low to facing any collinearities. I have performed 'regplot' to 
     see the collinearities.


d>:- I have identified the issues in the data set that multiple features have almost
     whole data is null, another one is more than 20 feature have in this data set 
     more than 75% data is null. Apart from this, I think I have not encountered 
     issues with anything else.

e>:- Issues I have found too many null values, to deal with I have performed a drop 
     function for that feature which has more than 35% data are null. That feature 
     which has 70% of data is not null to deal with it I have used the 'replace' 
     method with a mean() function. 

f>:- No there any data privacy and security issues in this dataset. 


2>Answer:-

a>:-    click-through rate = features/no. of sample *100
                           = 26/2380556*100%
                           = 0.001

       

b>:-    click-through rate(listing_stars) = 1/2382556*100
                                          = 4.2006993324248620910409164917776e-5 (values too low)
  



3>Answer:- 

a>:- I have selected the 'booked' feature from these three possible causes of the outcome.
     From these three outcomes booking_value features I have already deleted them because 
     in this feature have more than 90% of data is null. For the remaining 2, we can select
     any of them so, I have selected the 'booked' feature.


b>Answer:-

1>:- We have three output variables for performing the machine learning algorithm clicked,
     booking_value, and booked. From these three firstly I have dropped the booking_value 
     in this variable have more than 90% of data are null. Now we are free to use anyone 
     from the remaining 2, variables so, I have selected booked column.


2>:- I have used 27 columns from the 57 columns, the remaining 30 columns I have dropped 
     because in these columns have more than 75% of data are null. These 27 columns are 
     not highly colinear.

3>:- Pre-processing I have done in this problem is, describe, is null, drop, replace, 
     resample and check colinearities method. I have used it because this data set have 
     many null values data set imbalanced so, to deal with it I have used this method. If
     we have not use these techniques our model performance not well.

4>:- I have used the classification machine learning technique to perform the machine 
     learning operation because target columns have data categorical data.

5>:- Evaluation metrics I have used to optimize the machine learning model is accuracy_score,
     confusion_matrix, and classification_report. Classification reports give precision, recall,
     and f1-score. I have used this evaluation matrix because I have used the classification model.

6>:- I have used this evaluation matrix because models are classification model and not any 
     implications in this final matric values. 

7>:- My approach for a deal with the complex model is that do all pre-processing, transforming.
